# Establishment Node Services Dev
This is a development sandbox meant to ease the process of working on any of Establishment's node services and/or libraries.

## Installation
Assuming `git` is also already installed.
```bash
cd path/to/workspace
git clone https://github.com/establishment/establishment-node-services-dev
cd establishment-node-services-dev
./install.sh
```

## License
The Establishment Framework code (including `establishment-node-services-dev`) is released explicitly under public domain (AKA The Unlicence, I just like public domain more than the term "Unlicence").
There are no ugly copyright headers you need to keep, and you can copy/paste the code without any attribution.
It make it easier to bundle your code, so you know a minimized production js can strip all comments away.
In case you need extra assurance, this software is also licenced under [Creative Commons 0][license-cc0], you can pick your preferred licence.
